## 📚 React Fundamentals Used

3. **Local Storage**: For Storage to share cart and wishlist data across components.  
4. **Dynamic Routing**: For displaying specific product details pages using `react-router-dom`.  
5. **Reusable Components**: Components like Navbar, Footer, Product Card, and Sidebar ensure reusability and modularity.
